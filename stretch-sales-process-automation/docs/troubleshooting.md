# Troubleshooting

- **No Quote created at Proposal/Quote**  
  Ensure trigger is active and user has permissions on Quote.

- **Order not created when Quote accepted**  
  Confirm Quote.Status is exactly "Accepted".

- **Email not received**  
  Check Deliverability settings and Owner email.

- **ARES notification errors**  
  Make sure the AppExchange package is installed. Code guards publishing when package is absent.

- **Pricebook errors**  
  Make sure Opportunity has a Pricebook and OpportunityLineItems include PricebookEntryId.
